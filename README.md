## Getting Started

### Current Implementation
The project currently contains only the MAC array RTL implementation. To work with the current code:

1. **Review Architecture**: Read `docs/architecture.md` for detailed specifications
2. **Examine MAC Array**: Review `rtl/mac_array/mac_array.v` for the implemented MAC array module
3. **Simulation Setup**: Use a Verilog simulator to test the MAC array functionality

### Future Development
Once additional components are implemented:
1. **Setup Environment**: Install required tools (Verilog simulator, FPGA tools, TensorFlow Lite Micro)
2. **Run Verification**: Execute testbenches in `testbench/` directory
3. **Deploy Models**: Use models in `models/` directory for end-to-end testing

## Dependencies
- Verilog simulator (ModelSim/QuestaSim or open-source alternatives)
- FPGA synthesis tools (Vivado/Quartus)
- TensorFlow Lite Micro framework
- RISC-V toolchain
- Python for benchmarking and analysis
